Ques 1  122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time.
However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int p=0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length-1;i++){
            if(prices[i]<prices[i+1]){
                p+=prices[i+1]-prices[i];
            }
        }
        return p;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int sellingPrice=prices[0];int max=0;//maintained a fixed selling point first unlike above question
        for(int i=1;i<prices.length;i++){
            if(sellingPrice>prices[i]){
                sellingPrice=prices[i];
            }
            else if(max<prices[i]-sellingPrice){
                max=Math.max(max,prices[i]-sellingPrice);
            }
        }
        return max;
